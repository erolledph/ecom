# Helpdesk Notification System Improvements

## Overview
Improved the helpdesk notification system to reduce excessive notifications for premium users while providing better visibility for admins.

## Key Changes

### 1. Admin Badge System
- **NEW Badge**: Admins now see a "NEW" badge on unopened tickets in the helpdesk management list
- **Navigation Badge**: Admin sidebar shows a count badge of unopened tickets on "Helpdesk Management" link
- **Real-time Updates**: Badge counts update in real-time using Firebase subscriptions

### 2. Ticket Opening Tracking
- Added `openedByAdmin` field to track when an admin first opens a ticket
- When admin opens a ticket for the first time:
  - Ticket is marked as opened
  - User receives ONE notification: "Your ticket is now being reviewed by our support team"
  - Badge is removed from admin view

### 3. Smart Status Change Notifications
- Added `lastNotifiedStatus` field to track the last status notified to user
- Status change notifications are sent ONLY when the status actually changes
- Prevents duplicate notifications when admin changes status multiple times
- Clear status messages for users:
  - "reopened"
  - "is now being reviewed by our team"
  - "has been resolved"
  - "has been closed"

### 4. Reply Notifications
- Admin replies still send notifications to users
- Message changed to: "New reply from support on: [ticket subject]"
- Only ONE notification per admin reply

### 5. Removed Excessive Notifications
- No notifications for internal admin actions (viewing, updating fields, etc.)
- Status changes only notify if status is actually different
- Opening a ticket sends notification only once

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions
- `markTicketAsOpened(ticketId)`: Marks ticket as opened and sends initial notification
- `getUnreadTicketsCount()`: Gets count of unopened tickets
- `subscribeToUnreadTicketsCount(callback)`: Real-time subscription to unopened ticket count

### Updated Functions
- `updateTicketStatus()`: Now accepts `notifyUser` parameter and checks `lastNotifiedStatus`
- `addTicketReply()`: Updated notification message
- `createTicket()`: Initializes new tracking fields

### Database Fields Added
- `openedByAdmin`: boolean - Tracks if admin has viewed the ticket
- `lastNotifiedStatus`: string - Tracks last status user was notified about

## User Experience

### For Premium Users (Ticket Creators)
- Receive meaningful notifications only:
  1. When admin first opens their ticket
  2. When ticket status changes
  3. When admin replies
- No more spam from internal admin actions

### For Admins
- See at-a-glance which tickets are new with "NEW" badge
- Badge count in navigation shows total unopened tickets
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Clear visual indicators guide attention to new tickets

## Best Practices Followed
Based on industry-leading helpdesk systems:
- Notify users on meaningful status changes only
- One notification per significant action
- Badge/visual indicators for admins to manage workload
- Real-time updates for improved responsiveness
- Clear, user-friendly notification messages
