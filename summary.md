## Standard User Experience Analysis

### Current Restrictions Impact:
1. **Product Limit (30)**: Reasonable for beginners but may limit growth
2. **No Floating Widget**: Reduces engagement optimization capabilities
3. **No Pop-up Banner**: Limits promotional announcement options
4. **No Category Toggle**: Reduces layout control flexibility
5. **No Bulk Import**: Requires manual product entry (time-consuming for larger catalogs)
6. **No Data Export**: Prevents external analysis and marketing automation

### Recommendations for Balance:
- **Consider enabling floating widgets** for standard users as they significantly improve conversion rates
- **Maintain product limits** as they encourage upgrades while still allowing meaningful stores
- **Keep bulk import premium** as it's clearly a power-user feature
- **Consider making category toggle available** to all users for better UX control
