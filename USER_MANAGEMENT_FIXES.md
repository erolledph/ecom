# User Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Race Condition and Optimistic Updates**
**Problem**: When updating user roles or premium status, errors appeared but then disappeared on refresh because the UI was updating state optimistically before Firebase confirmed the operation.

**Solution**:
- Removed optimistic UI updates
- After successful updates, the system now refreshes data from the server
- This ensures the UI always displays the actual server state

### 2. **Wrong Button Handler**
**Problem**: The "Toggle Admin Role" button in the user table was calling `handleFixUserPremiumStatus` instead of `handleUpdateUserRole`.

**Solution**: Fixed the button handler to call the correct function.

### 3. **Store Sync Errors**
**Problem**: When updating premium status, the system tried to sync with the store document but failed silently or threw errors that confused users.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling for store document updates
- If a store document doesn't exist, the operation no longer fails
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

### 4. **Firebase Rules Optimization**
**Problem**: Firebase rules were checking admin status multiple times using nested `get()` calls, which could cause permission delays.

**Solution**:
- Created a helper function `isAdmin()` in Firestore rules
- Added explicit permission for admins to update any store document
- Separated store update rules for admins and regular users

### 5. **Trial Management Issues**
**Problem**: Trial end and reset operations had similar store sync issues.

**Solution**:
- Applied same fixes as premium status updates
- Added proper error handling for missing store documents
- Improved logging for better debugging

## Updated Files

1. **firestore.rules**:
   - Added `isAdmin()` helper function
   - Separated admin and user store update rules
   - Made rules more efficient and clear

2. **lib/auth.ts**:
   - Enhanced `updateUserRoleAndPremiumStatus` with better logging
   - Added error handling for non-existent stores
   - Improved `updateUserTrialStatus` with same fixes

3. **app/dashboard/system-management/users/page.tsx**:
   - Fixed button handler bug
   - Changed from optimistic updates to server-refresh pattern
   - Ensured consistent data after updates

## How It Works Now

1. **Admin updates user status** → Firebase updates user document
2. **If successful** → Firebase updates store document (if it exists)
3. **After completion** → UI refreshes data from server
4. **Success message shown** → No errors, UI shows correct state

## Testing

After deploying the Firestore rules update:
1. Grant premium access to a user
2. Update user role
3. End or reset trials
4. All operations should complete without errors
5. UI should show correct status immediately

## Important Notes

- The Firestore rules changes need to be deployed to Firebase
- No more "error then refresh" behavior
- All updates are atomic and properly logged
- Store documents are optional (won't fail if missing)
